Problem Statement:-
    
An online education institute sells courses to industry professionals. 

The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. 
Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a 
form providing their contact information and other details.
Once these forms are acquired, sales marketing  team start making calls, 
writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. 
its lead conversion rate is very poor say 30 percent. 

If they successfully identify this set of enquiries, the sales conversion rate should go up as 
the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential clients rather 
than making calls to everyone. 

Goal :- find the potential Probability of the sales enquiries.
assign a score between 0 and 100 to target potential leads. 

A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert 
whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
